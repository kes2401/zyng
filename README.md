# zyng
Simple CSS Grid

## Overview

zyng is a simple CSS grid using basic browser resets.

This project is in the very early stages of development. I've decided to put it together for use in my own projects, but once it is ready feel free to use it too if you wish. The zyng-grid file will be just the grid itself and the zyng-style will be the grid with some added styling for content, like text and images, and compenents, such as buttons and forms.

If you have any comments or suggestions feel free to get in touch, my email address is on my profile :)
