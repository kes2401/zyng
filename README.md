# zyng
A simple CSS Grid with a little style

## Overview

zyng is a simple CSS grid using basic browser resets.

This project is in the very early stages of development. I've decided to put this together for use in my own projects, but once its ready you can use it too if you wish. The zyng-grid file is just the grid itself and the zyng-style file is the grid with some added styling for content, like text and images, and compenents, such as buttons and forms, etc.
